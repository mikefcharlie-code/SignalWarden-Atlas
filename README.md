# SignalWarden Atlas

**Follow the signal. Trace the evidence. See the context.**

A local-first workspace for observations, evidence-linked analysis, source-cited reports, and offline world views. Bring telemetry and spatial context together, then inspect the sources, freshness, and gaps behind each finding. Core workflows run without a model or live feed.

## What you can do

| Capability | Implemented today |
|---|---|
| **Explore observations** | Search platform and sensor records with exact citations, provenance labels, freshness checks, and visible conflicts or missing data. |
| **Ask grounded questions** | Use deterministic evidence assessments and bounded scene queries without a model. Optional local Qwen can organize cited findings. |
| **Build cited reports** | Preview platform status, sensor provenance, incident timelines, data quality, and handoffs; export Markdown or JSON with evidence and coverage limits. |
| **Explore Atlas** | Open the map at 30.83857, -83.26409 and reference zoom 5.03; use display-only controls for cameras, aircraft, AIS, road incidents, and Georgia 511 road work/closures. The 511 feed requires a server-side developer key, configuration gates, the existing network opt-in, and a manual request. NASA GIBS satellite imagery is preselected but external tile requests remain off until a separate opt-in. The globe/map zoom conversion is approximate. |
| **Receive aircraft telemetry** | Read PX4/ArduPilot MAVLink over serial, UDP, or TCP with normalized observations and source/freshness labels. A separate opt-in WebSocket stream supports telemetry delivery. |
| **Review outages and recovery** | Inspect labeled in-memory snapshots and a return digest that separates API recovery from source recovery. Old observations remain old; reload clears retained state. |
| **Set up local models** | Explicit install, verification, cancellation, and inference workflows for Qwen, SSD-1B, Wan, ResNet-18, and X-CLIP. No automatic weight downloads; generated media stays outside observation evidence. |
| **Explore management demos** | Inventory and maintenance APIs, synthetic fleet views, a six-channel demo Camera Wall, disconnected Training C2, demo RBAC, and deterministic Tracegate evidence-readiness review. |
| **Analyze ground-vehicle scans** | Optional local-only relative LiDAR odometry from explicitly supplied KITTI-style scans; isolated from UAV telemetry, Warden-NAV, missions, and flight control. |

## Status and scope

**Simulation-first reference implementation—not flight-ready, field-validated, or production-validated.**

- **Receive-only telemetry; separate bounded commands.** The PX4/ArduPilot adapter still receives only and never transmits MAVLink. Synthetic fleet views are not bound to it. A separate, disabled-by-default [civilian operator command gateway](docs/civilian-operator-commands.md) can dispatch signed `hold`, `return_home`, and `land` requests to an independently provisioned civilian HTTPS bridge. It has no extra confirmation prompt. A bounded run may execute a fixed operator-authorized sequence with status visibility and abort; AI-generated live decisions, arbitrary commands, mission upload, targeting, arming, and weapon/effector tasking remain excluded. Training C2 remains browser-local. No real-hardware, SITL/HIL, or flight validation is claimed. Tracegate does not authorize flight or certify safety.
- **Local records, limited external reads.** The observation dataset is mock/offline; actual Lattice integration is absent. Manual, opt-in adapters cover USGS earthquakes, U.S. NOAA/NWS forecasts, and coarse adsb.lol positions—not dependable live-feed coverage. Provider terms, staleness, rate limits, and failures apply.
- **Original Atlas map, not full God's Eye parity.** No God's Eye imagery or provider datasets are bundled. NASA GIBS and other documented imagery/context adapters are optional, deployment-dependent reads with separate consent, attribution, and freshness requirements; keyed services require server configuration. Georgia 511 road-work and closure events are available through a separately gated, manually refreshed adapter when a server-side developer key is configured; its stated coverage is Georgia interstates and state routes, and local-road completeness is not documented. A missing result is not proof that roads are clear. TLE calculations are geometric estimates, not sightings or visibility forecasts.
- **Opt-in World View context relays.** The current tree also contains disabled-by-default, read-only AIS, weather/air, ocean, hazard, space, basemap, public-traffic, mobility, and GPSJAM relays. GPSJAM has its own checkbox, is a delayed daily inferred GNSS-interference aggregate (not a jammer detection/location), and is independent of the shared network toggle. The relays enforce bounded requests, keep credentials server-side, and label `not_configured`, stale, failed, synthetic, or unknown results. They provide context only—not navigation, identity, plate/face analysis, missions, controls, or effectors.
- **Validation has boundaries.** Model workflows were checked with fixtures/mocks, not actual weights or GPU inference. Browser checks exercised the SVG fallback, not WebGL. Model output is advisory, not verified detection; display filters do not add sensor capabilities.
- **Keep the reference API local.** Production authorization, rate limiting, and access-control hardening are incomplete. External AI requires separate configuration and export consent; local mode never silently falls back to it. Optional browser speech may use the browser vendor's service.

## Run locally

Requires Python 3.11+, Node.js, and the frontend's pinned pnpm version (10.12.1). From a checkout:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python services/management-api/app.py
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd apps/management-web
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

The root page opens **Atlas** (`/worldview`); **Observations** (`/observations`) and **Reports & documents** (`/reports`) remain available. Demonstrations use synthetic/local data; aircraft ingestion, streaming, model inference, and external reads each require separate setup.

The stack is React/TypeScript with Vite, Three.js and satellite.js, backed by a Python API and versioned JSON Schemas. Storage is in-memory by default; optional PostgreSQL setup is in the [API guide](services/management-api/README.md). Model-specific hardware and runtime requirements are in [local AI setup](docs/local-ai-setup.md); Wan requires CUDA.

## Local checks

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -q
pnpm --dir apps/management-web test
pnpm --dir apps/management-web typecheck
pnpm --dir apps/management-web build
python simulation/generate_telemetry.py --count 5
```

These are development checks, not certification. PostgreSQL has no replacement automated integration suite after removal of the Docker/Testcontainers tests. Record skipped checks in the [release checklist](docs/release-checklist.md).
